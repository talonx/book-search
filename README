= Book-Search - Search online bookstores

== An Overview
Book-Search is a ruby script to search multiple online bookstores in India. The original aim of this project was to find
the lowest price among all the stores. The current script just displays the results with prices and links to the sites.
Price-based listing is on the way!

== Supported sites

* Bookadda.com
* Infibeam.com
* Flipkart.com
* Indiaplaza.in

== Dependencies

Book-search uses the Hpricot HTML parser. http://github.com/whymirror/hpricot

The script uses screen scraping - so it's totally dependent on the stores' site's search results page structure. It'll break if the latter changes.

== Immediate ToDos
* Price based rankings, with lowest on top.
* Split the code into separate modules, so that bookstores can be added and removed easily.
